# wrpn_2.0

A build of the 2.0 version of Windows Reverse Polish Notation (HP 16C) calculator from
https://wrpn.emmet-gray.com/index.html. There was only source available, and I wanted
to use it on NT 4.0 so I built this binary. There's also an online version available here: http://www.wrpn.emmet-gray.com/wrpn/ 
but that won't help on an isolated retro network. The HP manual is here https://literature.hpcalc.org/items/589
